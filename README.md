# Cairo University Racing Team 2020 Driverless Electric Racing Vehicle

## Technical Requirements
### Mapping Accuracy
On average state estimation tolerance is less than 0.5 m localization error on the maximum look ahead distance.

### Latency
By simulating a top speed of  25 m/s (90 kph) on an acceleration track, this concluded a maximum view to actuation 200 ms in order for the vehicle to take action.

### Look-ahead distance
Look-ahead requirements depend on full-stack-latency, car dynamics, and camera properties. With some assumptions, the needed look-ahead distance 19.6 m

### Horizontal FOV
Given legal track dimensions, results in a minimum FOV of 101â—¦ .
