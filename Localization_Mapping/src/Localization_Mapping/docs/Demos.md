Global Mapping:

This video demonstrates the perception to global mapping. The cones detected by camera are plotted on a 2D map with us viewing from top. The coordinate axis is us moving with camera. The greenish umbrella is the range of detection of camera. If you look closely, there are two types of maps visible. First, a short term reactive map in form of dots and second a global map. Every cone on a global map starts as a huge blob and with time it's radius reduces. This indicates the car is more confident of cone being present there (hence the radius of cone is itÍ„s confidence radius).
